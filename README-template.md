## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the CSS property object-fit

### Continued development

Still have an issue with the section flexbox --> why does it not vertically center on the page?

### Useful resources

- [A complete guide to Flexbox] (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to understand how flexbox works.
